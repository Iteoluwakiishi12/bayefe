                "From the time we met till now you have been an absolute blessing to me and I appreciate you with everything I have." <br> <p>For all the times we used to send messages to ourselves to on 3 social media platforms at the same time like we are talking to differnt people. There is no dull moment with you and I'm grateful; For all the silly faces , for all the long cute calls, for all your annoying side üòÖ. </p>
                <br> The day we first talked honestly it was all supposed to be cruise but I'm glad it didn't all end there.  The moments we share the conversations we have are priceless and I won't give it up for anything.<br><br>
                You make me feel very happy and wanted and when everything seems to be falling out of place you give me this sense of assurance that it is well and I come to see it that way. So if anything thank you for being you. I'm grateful to have you by my side every step the way.
                As this special day emerges again, I want you to know that you are special to me and I wish you only the best things in life. May each moment pass with bliss and you stay surrounded by your well-wishers.
